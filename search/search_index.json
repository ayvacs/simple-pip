Here's a tutorial I made if you're interested: Open a stream or video on any Electron app. Copy the extension's main script to your clipboard. Open the developer tools on Twitch by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or \u2318+\u2325+I (macOS). Press Console in the top bar. Paste the code and press enter to execute it. It's a hacky method, but at least it works until other apps come up with their own official methods.","title":"How to use simple-pip with other apps"},{"location":"other-apps/#how-to-use-simple-pip-with-other-desktop-apps","text":"You can use this extension with most other apps built using Electron , since they allow you to execute code with the console.
