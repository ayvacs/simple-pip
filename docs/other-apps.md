# How to use simple-pip with other desktop apps

You can use this extension with most other apps built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org), since they allow you to execute code with the console.

Here's a tutorial I made if you're interested>

1. Open a stream or video on the Twitch app

1. Copy my [Picture in picture script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sleepiie/simple-pip/main/src/script.js)

1. Open the developer tools on Twitch, by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Opt+I

1. Press Console in the top bar.

1. Paste the code and press enter

It's a hacky method but at least it works until Twitch comes up with something official.
