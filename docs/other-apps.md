# How to use simple-pip with other desktop apps

You can use this extension with most other apps built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org), since they allow you to execute code with the console.

Here's a tutorial I made if you're interested:

1. Open a stream or video on any [Electron](https://electronjs.org) app.

1. Copy the extension's [main script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sleepiie/simple-pip/main/src/script.js) to your clipboard.

1. Open the developer tools on Twitch by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Windows) or **⌘+⌥+I** (macOS).

1. Press Console in the top bar.

1. Paste the code and press enter to execute it.

It's a hacky method, but at least it works until other apps come up with their own official methods.
